# guessing_game
Basic guessing game made with Rust

In this small project I learned about Rust:
   - Rust variable declaration
      - Signed vs Unsigned ( i, u )
   - Asking user input
   - Basic dependency management with Cargo.toml
   - Basic variable type conversion
   - Taking reference of a variable, instead of copying it
   - Variable value comparison with match keyword
   - Functions and their return values (->) and arguments.
